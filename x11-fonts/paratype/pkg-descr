The PT Public Pack from ParaType includes the PT Sans, PT Serif,
PT Mono, PT Astra Sans, PT Astra Serif, and PT Root UI font families,
all available under the SIL Open Font License.

PT Sans and PT Serif were developed as part of the
"Public Types of Russian Federation" project. The main
objective of the project is to allow the peoples of Russia to read
and write their native languages using free/libre fonts.
