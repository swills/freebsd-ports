First off a HUGE thanks go out to fjwcash@
for his relentless, and tireless work with this. I can't thank you enough!

That said, and for all others whom claim it doesn't work;
The answer(s) are as follows:

The following makes things work:

On the receiving server:
    sysctl net.inet6.ip6.v6only=0
    install bbcp-20150116.txz

On the sending server:
    sysctl net.inet6.ip6.v6only=0
    install bbcp-20150116.txz
    add "-4 c" to the start of the bbcp command

With the above, I am able to use the latest version of the bbcp package
to send data between servers.

Command-line used:

bbcp -4 c -N io "zfs send -I ${localpool}/${localfs}/${site}@${lastsnap} \
     ${localpool}/${localfs}/${site}@${yesterday}" \
     ${user}@${remotehost}:"${zfs} recv ${recvopts} ${rempool}"


Taken from the bbcp website (when in doubt, google it out):

--ipv4 [who] | -4 [who]
uses the IPv4 TCP stack for command processing and source-target connections.
This option is incompatible with IPv6 addresses. The optional who argument
restricts IPv4 mode to the command if c is specified, the source if s is
specified or the target if t is specified. The default is cst (i.e. everywhere).
If who is omitted and â€“-ipv4 is the last option on the command line it must
be followed by the -- option (double dash). 

So, it looks like the "-h" output should be updated to use:

[-4 [cst]]

Or similar, with an explanation of what c, s, and t stand for?

  -c ( Compression )

  -s ( Streams )

  -t ( tlim - (timelimit) )

On another note, "-4 s" and "-4 t" end with segmentation faults. 
The only option that works is "-4 c".

So, until, or unless I'm able to overcome the problems with the -s, and
-t switches; don't use them.

Thanks again, fjwcash@ !
