# ===================================================
# Directory for config files of third party modules.
#
# Modules can be disabled by adding a '#' in front
# of the "LoadModule" line e.g. "#LoadModule".
#
# Files are automatically included if the name
# begins with a three digit number followed by '_'
# and ending in '.conf' e.g. '080_mod_php.conf'.
#
# Maintainers can also include instructions on how to
# use the module(s) they maintain (instead of doing
# so in pkg-message).
