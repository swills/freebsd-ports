Enlightenment is classed as a "desktop shell" as it provides everything you
need to operate your desktop or laptop, but it is not a full application
suite. This covers functionality including launching applications, managing
their windows and performing system tasks like suspending, rebooting,
managing files and so on.
The Enlightenment Project is moving towards using Wayland as the base display
system, while Enlightenment itself is to become a full Wayland compositor
in its own right. This takes time, and there have been some bumps along the
road, but the goal is that support for X11 will be eventually be discontinued.
Enlightenment is built on top of the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL),
using the libraries written for the user interface as well as those for the
Compositor itself. This means that any improvements made to EFL are included
in the Enlightenment Compositor.
