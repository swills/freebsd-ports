libinput only supports evdev(4) devices, so

- If mouse/keyboard events are wanted build kernel with EVDEV_SUPPORT
- Make sure /dev/input/* are accessible by user or "video" group
- For arrow keys to work export XKB_DEFAULT_RULES=evdev via environ(7)
- For non-multiplexed events set sysctl kern.evdev.rcpt_mask=12
