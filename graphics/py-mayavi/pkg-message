You might need to define an environment variable when starting mayavi2 as e.g. in:

 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/gcc48 mayavi2

An alias for this command might simplify the use of the mayavi2 script. Note that
the version number might need adjusting to the gcc installed on your system.
This is a temporary workaround. A solution for the root problem is under
preparation.
