The Facebook Business SDK is a one-stop shop to help our partners better serve
their businesses. Partners are using multiple Facebook API's to server the
needs of their clients. Adopting all these API's and keeping them up to date
across the various platforms can be time consuming and ultimately prohibitive.
For this reason Facebook has developed the Business SDK bundling many of its
APIs into one SDK to ease implementation and upkeep. The Business SDK is an
upgraded version of the Marketing API SDK that includes the Marketing API as
well as many Facebook APIs from different platforms such as Pages,
Business Manager, Instagram, etc.
