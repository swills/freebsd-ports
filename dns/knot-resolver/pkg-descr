Knot Resolver is a caching full resolver implementation written in
C and LuaJIT, both a resolver library and a daemon. The core
architecture is tiny and efficient, and provides a foundation and
a state-machine like API for extensions. There are three modules
built-in â€“ iterator, validator, cache, and a few more are loaded
by default. Most of the rich features are written in Lua(JIT) and
C. Batteries are included, but optional.

Modular architecture of the library keeps the core tiny and efficient,
and provides a state-machine like API for extensions. The Lua modules,
switchable and shareable cache, and fast FFI bindings makes
it great to tap into resolution process, or be used for your recursive
DNS service. It's the OpenResty of DNS.
